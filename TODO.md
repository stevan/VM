# VM

## TODO:

- run should return a VM::State object
    - we can inspect these in tests

- run should accept a number of cycles to perform
    - and because it returns the VM::State
        - this could become a Thread ... hmm

- write more tests
    - for errors in particular

- Instructions for:
    - VECTORS
        - maybe for SIMD instructions
