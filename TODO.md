## TODO:

- Instructions for:
    - ARRAYS
        - we have CREATE and INDEX, but need more now
    - VECTORS
        - this is homogeneous arrays (all the same type)
        - maybe for SIMD instructions

- Memory
    - need to reclaim freed cells
    - do Pointers need to be more sophisticated?
        - should I be tracking them?
