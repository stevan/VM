## TODO:

- Instructions for:
    - ARRAYS
        - can they be a single type? problem: We don't have type information anymore :(
        - if they can be of any scalar type, why have tuples?
    - RECORDS
    - maybe add:
        - VECTORS (for SIMD instructions)
        - PAIRS (for Cons Lists)
            - these could just be 2 element tuples


- Memory
    - index for free empty cells
    - compaction
        -
